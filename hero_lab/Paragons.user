While some call it the Deep Resonance, for lack of a better word, it is the consciousness of the virtual world that permeates everything, the embodiment of virtual harmony, the essence of the code. Followers of Zero-One tend to seek it for guidance and inspiration.
  - Advantages: +2 die for compiling and registering sprites of any type
  - Disadvantages: Zero-One is the perfection of the code and demands the same from his followers, or at least teaches them a harsh lesson if they fail. Zero-One technomancers must spend 2 points of Edge to negate a glitch or downgrade a critical glitch." compset="Quality" uniqueness="useronce">
